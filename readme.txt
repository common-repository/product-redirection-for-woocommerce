== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I use this? =

Deleting products is bad for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and setting redirects through apache can lead to a huge htaccess.

= Why are fields on products not loading? =

If you have ACF installed already, you may need to sync the fields, as they are stored via json to reduce db calls. We built this around ACF to reduce development times and to prevent adding unnecessary code if you already have it installed.

= Why does this use ACF? =

Mainly to reduce the amount of time in development, but also to save resources. If you already have Advanced Custom Fields installed, then you don't have to worry about additional code executing on product admin pages.
